METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION 

In summary: 

---
Fish Biomass: collected via underwater visual census using a 50m transect. Detailed methods are available on the Reef Life Survey methods page: https://reeflifesurvey.com/methods/ and described in *Reef Life Survey: Establishing the Ecological Basis for Conservation of Shallow Marine Life* (Edgar et al., 2020, Biological Conservation).

Environmental Variables: broad-scale, remotely sensed environmental covariates were obtained from Bio-Oracle (https://www.bio-oracle.org/index.php), representing surface mean values at each site (2000â€“2020), extracted from rasters with a native resolution of 5-arcmins.

Human Gravity: calculated using the gravity of human impact model described in *Gravity of Human Impacts Mediates Coral Reef Conservation Gains* (Cinner et al., 2018, PNAS).

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita: 

Human  Development Index (HDI): 

MPA size, age, level of fishing protection:
